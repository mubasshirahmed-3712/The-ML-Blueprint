# 🧠 Classification Algorithms

Welcome to the **Classification** section of *The ML Blueprint*!  
This module focuses on **supervised learning techniques** that predict **categorical outcomes** (e.g., Yes/No, Fraud/Not Fraud, Spam/Not Spam).

## 📌 What is Classification?
Classification is a type of **supervised learning** where the goal is to assign input data into one of the predefined categories or classes.

💡 Example: Predicting whether a user will purchase a product based on age and salary.

## 📊 Algorithms Covered Here
We will explore various classification techniques step by step, starting from simple to advanced:

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - A linear classifier that uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map predictions into probabilities between 0 and 1.  
   - 📂 Implemented in: `Logistic_Regression/`

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** *(to be added later)*  
   - Classifies data points based on the majority label of their nearest neighbors.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** *(to be added later)*  
   - Finds the best hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin.

4. **Decision Trees & Random Forests** *(to be added later)*  
   - Tree-based methods for both simple and ensemble classification.

## 📈 Key Metrics for Classification
When evaluating classification models, we use:

- **Confusion Matrix** → Shows correct vs. incorrect predictions  
- **Accuracy** → Overall correctness of predictions  
- **Precision & Recall** → How well the model identifies positive cases  
- **F1-Score** → Balance between precision and recall

## 🚀 What We Did Here
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** on a dataset predicting whether users purchased a car based on **Age** & **Estimated Salary**.  
- Understood the **mathematics behind the sigmoid function** and decision boundary.  
- Visualized results for both training and test sets to see how well the model separates the classes.  
- Evaluated the model using **Confusion Matrix**, **Accuracy Score**, and **Classification Report**.
