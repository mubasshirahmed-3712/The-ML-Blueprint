# ðŸŒ€ Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning technique** where data is grouped into clusters based on similarity. Unlike regression or classification, clustering doesnâ€™t rely on predefined labels. Instead, it discovers patterns and structures hidden in the data.

## ðŸ“˜ What We Did
In this section, we implemented different clustering algorithms to explore how data can be grouped without supervision. Each algorithm brings its own way of understanding hidden patterns.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Algorithms Covered

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
- A centroid-based algorithm that divides data into *K clusters*.
- Works by minimizing the distance between points and their assigned cluster centroid.
- Best for spherical-shaped clusters.

### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Builds a hierarchy of clusters using either:
  - Agglomerative (bottom-up)
  - Divisive (top-down)
- Results are visualized using a dendrogram.

### 3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- Groups together points that are closely packed.
- Able to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters and handle noise (outliers).

### 4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- A probabilistic model that assumes data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.
- Provides flexibility for clusters of different shapes.

## ðŸ“Š Theory Highlights
- **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine similarity, etc. are key to clustering performance.
- **Choosing K (in K-Means)**: Methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score help decide the optimal number of clusters.
- **Scalability**: K-Means is computationally efficient, while DBSCAN and Hierarchical can be more resource-intensive.
