# 🧩 Classification Algorithms  
*Turning Data into Decisions with Predictive Models*

---

## 📌 What is Classification?
**Classification** is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict **categorical outcomes** (e.g., spam vs. not spam, churn vs. retain, disease vs. healthy).  
Unlike regression, where outputs are continuous, classification assigns inputs into **discrete classes**.

**Key Idea:**  
> Classification models learn from labeled training data and use decision boundaries to assign new inputs into categories.

## 📖 Algorithms Covered

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
- Works well for binary classification.
- Uses the **sigmoid function** to output probabilities.
- Extended with PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
📂 [Logistic Regression Folder](./1.Logistic_Regression)

---

### 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Instance-based learning.
- Classifies based on the majority label of the `k` nearest neighbors.  
📂 [KNN Classifier Folder](./2.KNN_Classifier)

---

### 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Finds the **optimal hyperplane** to separate classes.
- Works with linear and non-linear kernels (RBF, polynomial).  
📂 [SVM Classifier Folder](./3.SVM_Classifier)

### 🔹 Naïve Bayes
- Probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes’ Theorem**.
- Variants: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli.  
📂 [Naive Bayes Folder](./4.Naive_Bayes)

---

### 🔹 Decision Tree Classifier
- Splits data using **information gain / Gini index**.
- Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.  
📂 [Decision Tree Folder](./5.DecisionTree_Classifier)
